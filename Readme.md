This branch has the @ commands added all of Part 1 should work now.<br>
Configure should work now, and exit is no longer returning an error message as I implemented my own exit in the parserhelper.java file. <br>
Part 2 has been added, however clock is not working as intended. If it is not fixed with jar v3 then I will ask the teacher. <br>
The teacher said he would make a new jar so I will revisit and see if exit works with .jar v3<br>
